      <p>The Solovay-Kitaev (SK) Theorem is an important result in quantum computing as it states that a set of quantum gates can construct an approximation to an arbitrary quantum gate. 
        In doing so, it helps to narrow down the variety of gates that must be natively made available on quantum computing hardware to execute a particular algorithm.  
        An example of this is Shor's algorithm, which requires \(\pi / 2^{k}\) rotations, while the available fault-tolerant gates may be limited to the \(\pi / 8\) gate and Clifford group gates.</p>
       <p>This article aims to provide an accessible introduction to the theorem and explore the use of group theory in concretely describing the algorithm.</p>


       <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?</span></h5>
       <p>Let's start by breaking down the benefits of the SK theorem where each gate is simulated by \(O\left( \log^{c}(f(n) / \epsilon)\right)\) gates. 
           The set of gates we have available to run is limited. This limitation could be due to the qubits not being fault-tolerant, that is they are prone to noise and decoherence</p>
        <p>Suppose we need to run a quantum cicuit with \(f(n)\) gates, where \(n\) is the number of qubits. If we denote the circuit's tolerance of error by \(\epsilon\), then each individual gate's tolrenace to error must be
            \(\epsilon / f(n)\) each. This implies the total number of fault-tolerant gates required in the algorithm to be \(\Theta (f(n)^2 / \epsilon)\), a polynomial increase which is too much. 
            Instead, as we shall see, the SK theorem offers a polylogarithmic amount of gates, which is bearable.</p>
            <p>It provides an alternative sequence of gates that is both, accurate and efficient. 
              Using this theorem, each gate can be simulated by a \(O\left( \log^{c}(f(n) / \epsilon)\right)\) number of gates with a total computational cost of \(O\left(f(n) \log ^{c}(f(n) / \epsilon)\right)\),
               where \(c\) is a small constant [1]. </p>
        <p>It must be noted that when discussing fault-tolerant gates, such operations involve multiple physical qubits for error correction as well as extensive mechanisms to prevent decoherence. 
          These operations are quite exhaustive as they are, so a reduction in the number of these gates required by the algorithm is helpful. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">KEY INGREDIENTS</span></h5>
     <p>Before we dive into the theorem, we need to be familiar with certain concepts.</p> 
     <p>A gate on \(n\) quantum bits (qubits) is represented by a unitary transformation on a \(2^n\)-dimensional
      vector space. The set of all determinant-one (special) unitary transformations of a d-dimensional vector space is \(SU(d)\).</p>
     <p>A functional description of the SK theorem is as follows.</p>
     <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
       <p>Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the set of gates for \(S U(d)\), and let a desired
        accuracy \(\epsilon>0\) be given. There is a constant \(c\) such that for any \(U \in S U(d)\) there exists a
        finite sequence \(S\) of gates from \(\mathcal{G}\) of length \(O\left(\log ^{c}(1 / \epsilon)\right)\) and such that \(d(U, S)<\epsilon\).</p>
      </div>
      <p>Here, \(\mathcal{G}\) is the set of the aforementioned available gates, 
        \(S\) is the sequence of gates \(g_{1}g_{2}...g_{m}\) substituting as an approximation to the gate \(U\) and \(d(U, S)\) quantifies the <i>distance</i> between the two matrices, \(U\) and \(S\). 
        This distance measure is important as it is used to gauge the approximation's accuracy to the unitary gate. Specifically, \(S\) is said to be \(\epsilon\)-approximate to a quantum gate \(U\) if 
        \(d(U, S) \equiv\|U-S\| < \epsilon \).</p>
      <p>These gates(\(g\)) in set \(\mathcal{G}\) must satisfy the following conditions <cite>[2]</cite>:  </p>
      <p>1. All gates \(g \in \mathcal{G}\) are in \(S U(d)\), that is, they are unitary and have determinant 1.</p>
      <p>2. For each \(g \in \mathcal{G}\) the inverse operation \(g^{\dagger}\) is also in \(\mathcal{G}\).</p>
      <p>3. \(\mathcal{G}\) is a universal set for \(S U(d)\), i.e., the group generated by \(\mathcal{G}\) is <b>dense</b> in \(S U(d)\). This
        means that given any quantum gate \(U \in S U(d)\) and any accuracy \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists a
        product \(S \equiv g_{1} \ldots g_{m}\) of gates from \(\mathcal{G}\) which is an \(\epsilon\)-approximation to \(U\).</p>
      <p>The last point needs some clarification. A subset \(S\) of \(S U (2)\) is said to be a <b>dense subset</b> of \(S U (2)\), if any element \(U\) in \(S U (2)\) has an element \(s \in S\) that is close enough to it i.e. 
        within an \(\epsilon\) distance of it. Furthermore, suppose \(S\) and \(W\) are subsets of \(S U (2)\). Then, \(S\) is said to form an \(\epsilon\)-net of \(W\), where \(\epsilon\) > 0,
         if every point in \(W\) is within a distance \(\epsilon\) of some point \(S\).</p>
         <p>A word of length \(l\) from \(\mathcal{G}\) is a product \(g_1 g_2 ... g_l \in SU(2)\), where \(g_i \in \mathcal{G}\) for each \(i\). \(\mathcal{G}_l\) is the set of all words of length at most \(l\),
         and \(\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle\) is the set of all words of finite length.
         </p>
        <p>To describe the increasing proximity of successive points of \(\mathcal{G}_l\), we will need the following lemma, where \(S_{\epsilon}\) is the set of all points \(U\) in \(SU(2)\) 
          such that \(D(U,I) \le \epsilon\).</p>
         <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
          <p>Lemma: Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a finite set of elements in \(SU(2)\) containing its own inverses, and such that \(\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle\) is dense in \(SU(2)\). 
            There exists a universal constant \(\epsilon_0\) independent of \(\mathcal{G}\), such that for any \(\epsilon \le \epsilon_0\), if \(\mathcal{G}_l\) is an \(\epsilon^2\)-net
            for \(S_{\epsilon}\), then \(\mathcal{G}_{5 l}\) is a \(C \epsilon^3\)-net for \(S_{\sqrt{C} \epsilon^{3/2}}\), for some constant \(C\). </p>
         </div>
         <p>This lemma aims to simplify the multiplication of elements of \(SU(2)\) in the neighbourhood of the identity by using the group commutator,
            defined as \([U,V]_{gp} \equiv UVU^{\dagger}V^{\dagger}\) where \(U,V \in SU(2)\).
            This can be used to demonstrate that taking the group commutators of elements \(U\) and \(V\) in \(S_{\epsilon}\) fills in \(S_{\epsilon^2}\) much more densely, which is expressed in the header image.
        </p>
         <p>We can apply the lemma to illustrate how quickly \(\mathcal{G}_l\) fills up. If \(\mathcal{G}\) is dense in \(SU(2)\), then there is an \(l_0\) such that \(\mathcal{G}_{l_0}\)
           is an \(\epsilon_0^2\)-net for \(SU(2)\), and also \(S_{\epsilon_0}\). We know from the lemma, that if \(\epsilon = \epsilon_0\) and \(l=l_0\), then \(\mathcal{G}_{5 l_0}\) is a \(C \epsilon_0^3\)-net
          for \(S_{\sqrt{C} \epsilon_0^{3/2}}\). Applying lemma again with \(\epsilon = \sqrt{C} \epsilon_0^{3/2}\) and \(l = 5 l_0\) means that \(\mathcal{G}_{5^2 l_0}\) is a \(C(\sqrt{C} \epsilon_0^{3/2})^3\)-net
        for set \(S_{\sqrt{C}(\sqrt{C} \epsilon_0^{3/2})^{3/2}}\). If we keep going like this, we can obtain a generalised form for iterations \(\mathcal{G}_{5^{k}l_0}\) giving 
        \(\epsilon(k)^2\)-net for \(S_{\epsilon(k)}\), where </p>
        <p>$$\epsilon(k) = \frac{(C\epsilon_0)^{(3/2)^k}}{C}$$</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">THE THEOREM</span></h5>
    <p>Now that we have built an broad understanding of what the theorem is and what it is aimed towards, we can accurately state the Solovay-Kitaev theorem <cite>[1]</cite>.</p>
    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p><i>Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a finite set of elements in \(SU(2)\) containing its own inverses, such that \(\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle\) is dense in \(SU(2)\). Let \(\epsilon > 0\) be given. Then 
            \(\mathcal{G}_{l}\) is an \(\epsilon\)-net in \(SU(2)\) for \(l = O(log^{c}(1/\epsilon))\), where \(c \approx 4\). </i></p>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">THE ALGORITHM</span></h5>
    <p>The algorithm requires two inputs \(U\) which is the gate we are approximating to and \(n\), which determines the accuracy of the approximation. The accuracy is given by \(\epsilon_n\), 
      which is a decreasing function of \(n\), \(\epsilon_{n} \rightarrow 0\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\).</p>
    <p>It is a recursive algorithm which seeks out the approximation to the unitary gate by finding each part of the string of gates, one at a time. </p>
    <p>We begin by looking up an initial gate \(U_0\) that is \(\epsilon_0\)-approximate to \(U\). Then, we define a gate \(V\) such that \(V U_0 = U \) which makes \(V \equiv U U^{\dagger}_0\). 
      Thus, \(D(V, I)=\operatorname{tr}|V-I|=\operatorname{tr}\left|\left(U-U_{0}\right) U_{0}^{\dagger}\right|=\operatorname{tr}\left|U-U_{0}\right|<\epsilon(0)^{2}<\epsilon(1)\).</p>
      <p> We find a successive approximation to \(V\), such that it moves the product of gates closer to \(U\). Recall lemma in order to determine the next gate iteration \(U_{1} \in \mathcal{G}_{5 l_{0}}\),
     which is an \(\epsilon(1)^2\)-approximation to \(V\) and \(U_1 U_0\) is an \(\epsilon(1)^2\)-approximation to \(U\). </p>
     <p>If we do this recurrently, we get \(U_{k} U_{k-1} \ldots U_{0}\) which is an \(\epsilon(k)^{2}\)-approximation to \(U\) where \(U_{k} \in \mathcal{G}_{5^{k} l_{0}}\).
    </p>
    <p>Hence, a gate can be approximated using sequence of \(l_{0}+5 l_{0}+\cdots+5^{k} l_{0}<\frac{5}{4} 5^{k} l_{0}\) gates to an accuracy \(\epsilon(k)^{2}<\epsilon\) for any chosen \(k\). </p>
<p> Expanding the expression for \(\epsilon(k)\) gives,</p>
<p>$$
  \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{k}<\frac{\log \left(1 / C^{2} \epsilon\right)}{2 \log \left(1 / C \epsilon_{0}\right)}
  $$</p>
  <p>So, the number of gates required to approximate to within \(\epsilon\) satisfies (\(c = \log 5 / \log (3 / 2) \approx 4\)) </p>
  <p>$$
    \text { number of gates }<\frac{5}{4} 5^{k} l_{0}=\frac{5}{4}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{k c} l_{0}<\frac{5}{4}\left(\frac{\log \left(1 / C^{2} \epsilon\right)}{2 \log \left(1 / C \epsilon_{0}\right)}\right)^{c} l_{0}
    $$</p>
    <p>This is, as previously stated, the reason that the number of gates required to approximate are \(O(\log^{c}(1/\epsilon))\).</p>
